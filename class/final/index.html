                    <p>Montgomery County Public Libraries (MCPL) has reported a significant increase in the number of
                        borrowed electronic items from all branches in their system. The surge in demand for eBooks and
                        eAudiobooks reflects the evolving reading habits and the growing popularity of digital content.
                    </p>
                    <p>According to MCPL, the number of eMaterials, like eBooks and eAudiobooks, borrowed in the past
                        couple of years has increased by 40% compared to years prior. This surge in demand is not
                        limited to
                        a specific age group, but it includes a wide range of readers, from children to seniors. The
                        trend
                        is seen across all 22 branches of MCPL, with some branches reporting an increase of over 50%.

                            <p>The increase in borrowing electronic items from MCPL is not surprising, given the changes
                                in
                                reading
                                habits brought about by the pandemic. With people spending more time at home, the demand
                                for
                                digital
                                content has surged. In addition, the convenience of borrowing books without leaving
                                one's home
                                has
                                become more appealing to readers. "I’ve gotten some eBooks from here a couple of times,"
                                said
                                Britney Fru, a Montgomery County
                                resident who frequents the Wheaton Library. "The library has a good variety of books to
                                choose
                                from.”</p>

                    <p>MCPL has been working to keep up with the increased demand for digital content. The library
                        system
                        has invested in expanding its collection of eBooks and eAudiobooks to offer more choices for
                        readers. They have also increased the number of digital copies of popular titles to reduce wait
                        times for patrons.</p>
                    <p>"Our most loaned materials are still physical books, particularly children's books, which makes
                        sense since they are shorter, and most families check them out a few dozen at a time. Physical
                        books are still most popular in the adult collection as well, but they are quickly being caught
                        up to by our eBook and eAudiobooks, that many people access through their mobile devices," said
                        Felicity Brown, the Collection Management Manager for MCPL.</p>
                    <p>The increased borrowing of electronic items from MCPL is part of a broader trend in the library
                        world. According to the American Library Association, the demand for eBooks and eAudiobooks has
                        grown steadily over the past decade. As a result, the digital circulation of public libraries
                        has
                        been increasing at a faster rate than the circulation of physical materials.</p>
                    <p>Despite the increase in demand for digital content, MCPL emphasizes the importance of maintaining
                        a
                        balance between electronic and physical resources. The library system continues to offer a wide
                        variety of physical materials, including books, magazines, DVDs, and more. “We always encourage
                        members of the community to make greater use of all of our resources,” said
                        MCPL librarian Jeff Coster.</p>

                    </script>
                    <p>Brown also believes that more residents should take advantage of the resources the library system
                        offers. "It's all free! Our eResources are available 24/7, even when our physical buildings are
                        closed. And for our physical collection, if we don't own it in our library system, we're happy
                        to borrow it from another library system for our customers if it's available. We have programs
                        for all ages and interests, and the library is great way to learn something or try something
                        new."</p>

                    As the pandemic continues to reshape how we live and work, the demand for digital content will
                    likely continue growing. MCPL and other libraries nationwide are poised to meet this demand,
                    providing readers with access to high-quality digital resources and ensuring their libraries remain
                    vibrant and relevant in the digital age.

                    MCPL offers free library cards to those residing in Montgomery County or surrounding locations. You
