            <h1>Alien Series</h1>
            <h2>Premise</h2>
            <p>The Alien franchise depicts a series of deadly encounters, predominantly spanning the 21st and 24th
                centuries, between humanity and the Aliens; a hostile, endoparasitoid, extraterrestrial species.
                Humanity is depicted as a space-faring species with an interstellar dominion; space journeys typically
                last months, even years, and require the use of cryosleep. Throughout the series, characters are
                repeatedly manipulated and endangered by the unscrupulous megacorporation Weyland-Yutani Corp, which
                seeks to profit from the Aliens.
                The series fictionalizes the origin of the human race. A member of an ancient humanoid species, called
                the "Engineers", sacrifices himself, allowing his DNA to spark the genesis of mankind. The Engineers'
                other experiments, designed to exterminate the human race through the means of a deadly mutagen, paves
                the way for the Aliens to rise and populate through the traumatic implantation of larvae in hosts.
                Incidents across several generations are chronicled throughout the franchise.</p>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Writer Dan O'Bannon, wanting to write a science-fiction action film, collaborated with screenwriter
                Ronald Shusett on a script, initially titled Star Beast, but eventually changed to Alien. Brandywine
                Productions, a company which had a distribution deal with 20th Century Fox, bought the script. The
                writers expected it to be a low-budget film, but the success of Star Wars inclined Fox to invest
                millions.
                In the original script, the ship had an all-male crew, though it noted that all parts were
                gender-interchangeable. The Ripley character was initially to be played by Tom Skerritt, but when Fox
                president Alan Ladd Jr. and the producers at Brandywine heard rumors of Fox working on other titles with
                strong female leads, it was decided to cast a female as Ripley and Skerritt became Captain Dallas.
                Swiss painter and sculptor H. R. Giger designed the alien creature's adult form and the derelict ship,
                while French artist Mœbius created the look of the spacesuits and Ron Cobb provided most of the
                industrial design for the sets.
                While Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, was successful, Fox did not consider a sequel until 1983, when
                James Cameron expressed his interest to producer David Giler in continuing the Alien story. After
                Cameron's The Terminator became a box office hit, Cameron and partner Gale Anne Hurd were given approval
                to direct and produce the sequel to Alien, scheduled for a 1986 release. Cameron wrote the screenplay
                for Aliens from a story he developed with Giler and Walter Hill.
                Following the second film, Weaver was not interested in returning to the series, so Giler and Hill
                commissioned a sequel without the Ripley character. Fox's president Joe Roth opposed Ripley's removal,
                and Weaver was offered a $5 million salary and a producer credit to make Alien 3. Giler, Hill and Larry
                Ferguson wrote the screenplay, based on a story from an earlier script by Vincent Ward, intended to
                bring closure to the Alien franchise by killing off Ripley, the principal character. Alien 3 faced a
                mired production, with extensive script difficulties, trouble securing a director, production beginning
                prior to the completion of a final script, as well as profuse studio interference.
                While fans and critics initially did not receive Alien 3 well, the film was a worldwide success and
                piqued Fox's interest in continuing the franchise. In 1996, production on the fourth Alien film, Alien
                Resurrection, began. Ripley was not in the script's first draft, and Weaver was not interested in
                reprising the role. She joined the project after being offered an $11 million salary and more creative
                control, including director approval. The script, set 200 years after Alien 3, resurrected the Ripley
                character via human cloning. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, experienced an extended
                production, and screenwriter Joss Whedon later recounted that it had done "everything wrong" with his
                script. The film was released in 1997 to mixed reviews and modest box office returns, and is
                unsucceeded.</p>

            <h2>Original series</h2>
            <h3>Alien (1979)</h3>
            <p>On its way back to Earth, the commercial towing vehicle Nostromo is diverted to a desolate planetoid by a
                cryptic signal from a derelict alien spacecraft. Inside the alien ship, the crew discovers thousands of
                egg-like objects. A creature, released from one of the eggs, attaches itself to a crewman's face,
                rendering him unconscious. The others break quarantine to return him to the Nostromo. The parasite dies
                and the crewman wakes up, seemingly unaffected. Soon afterwards, an alien organism bursts from his chest
                and grows rapidly into a large lethal creature, which the surviving crew attempt to kill. The Nostromo
                is destroyed in an unsuccessful attempt to kill the creature, leaving Ellen Ripley as the only survivor
                in the ship's lifeboat.</p>
            <h3>Aliens (1986)</h3>
            <p>After 57 years in hypersleep, Ripley awakens aboard a medical space station orbiting Earth. She recounts
                the events of the Nostromo but is disbelieved by her superiors in the Weyland Yutani corporation, which
                has now begun to terraform and colonise the planetoid from the first film. When contact with the colony
                is lost, Ripley is persuaded to accompany a squad of marines to investigate. They discover the colonists
                have been wiped out after being directed by the company to secure the derelict ship reported by Ripley.
                There is only one survivor, a girl named Newt. The aliens vastly outnumber and quickly overwhelm the
                marines, who fight for survival. Only a handful, including Ripley and Newt, escape.</p>
            <h3>Alien 3 (1992)</h3>
            <p>Immediately following the events of Aliens, the military ship USS Sulaco, carrying the survivors, catches
                fire. The occupants are ejected in an escape pod, which crash-lands on the refinery/prison planet
                Fiorina "Fury" 161. All on board except Ripley are killed. An alien facehugger is also aboard, and
                impregnates an animal with an alien, which soon begins killing inmates and wardens. Ripley discovers an
                alien queen is growing inside her, and is determined to kill both herself and the creature before
                Weyland Yutani can exploit them.</p>
            <h3>Alien Resurrection (1997)</h3>
            <p>Two hundred years after the events of Alien 3, several clones of Ripley, including the alien queen she
                was carrying, are grown by the military aboard the USM Auriga. The military intends to exploit the
                aliens, and uses humans kidnapped and delivered to them by a group of mercenaries as hosts for the
                queen's eggs. The Aliens escape, and Ripley 8 (a clone mixed with Alien DNA) and the mercenaries attempt
                to escape and destroy the Auriga before it reaches Earth.</p>
            <h2>Crossover Series</h2>
            <h3>Alien vs. Predator (2004)</h3>
            <p>In 2004, a Predator mothership arrives in Earth orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training
                ground on Bouvetøya, an island about one thousand miles north of Antarctica. A buried pyramid giving off
                a "heat bloom" attracts a group of explorers led by billionaire and self-taught engineer Charles Bishop
                Weyland (Lance Henriksen), the original founder and CEO of Weyland Industries, who unknowingly activates
                an Alien egg production line as a hibernating Alien Queen is awakened within the pyramid. Three
                Predators descend unto the planet and enters the structure, killing all humans in their way with the
                intention of hunting the newly formed Aliens, while the scattered explorers are captured alive by Aliens
                and implanted with embryos. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle with an Alien, while the third
                allies itself with the lone surviving human, Alexa "Lex" Woods (Sanaa Lathan), while making their way
                out of the pyramid as it is destroyed by the Predator's wrist bomb and eventually does battle with the
                escaped Alien Queen on the surface. The Queen is defeated by being dragged down by a water tower into
                the dark depths of the frozen sea, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The orbiting
                Predator mothership uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Lex a
                spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once in orbit it is revealed that an Alien Chestburster
                was present within the corpse, thus a Predalien hybrid is born.</p>
            <h3>Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)</h3>
            <p>Set immediately after the events of the previous film, the Predalien hybrid aboard the Predator scout
                ship, having just separated from the mothership shown in the previous film, has grown to full adult size
                and sets about killing the Predators aboard the ship, causing it to crash in the small town of Gunnison,
                Colorado. The last surviving Predator activates a distress beacon containing a video recording of the
                Predalien, which is received by a veteran Predator on the Predator homeworld, who sets off towards Earth
                to "clean up" the infestation. When it arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the
                sewer below the town. He removes evidence of their presence as he moves along using a corrosive blue
                liquid and uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into
                the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from its remaining plasma caster and hunts Aliens
                all across town, accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process. During a confrontation with
                human survivors, the Predator loses its plasma pistol. The Predator then fights the Predalien
                singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the US air force drops a tactical nuclear
                bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants along with the Predalien's warriors and hive, as well as
                the few remaining humans in the town. The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken to a Ms. Cullen Yutani of
                the Yutani Corporation, foreshadowing an advancement in technology leading to the future events of the
                Alien films.</p>
            <h2>Prequel series</h2>
            <h3>Prometheus (2012)</h3>
            <p>Some 30 years before the events of Alien, scientists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star
                map among the remnants of several ancient Earth cultures. Accompanied by David 8 and hoping to discover
                the origins of humanity, they journey aboard the spaceship USCSS Prometheus and arrive on the distant
                planet LV-223 in the Zeta2 Reticuli system, the same region of space in which the planetoid LV-426 from
                Alien is found. There they discover the ancient remains of an advanced civilization, called the
                Engineers (the same race as the dead pilot from the derelict ship in Alien), who were developing
                biological weapons in the form of a pathogenic mutagen which could have driven the human race extinct.
                The horrors they encounter result in the loss of the crew except for David and Shaw.</p>
            <h3>Alien: Covenant (2017)</h3>
            <p>Eleven years after the events of Prometheus, the colony ship USCSS Covenant, carrying thousands of
                colonists and hundreds of human embryos in cryo-stasis, makes its way towards the planet Origae-6. The
                crew is awakened by a neutrino blast and intercepts a transmission sent from Shaw, which they decide to
                trace to an apparently habitable Engineer home world (referred to as Planet 4), devoid of all non-floral
                life. When several crew members are infected by the same mutagen encountered by the Prometheus crew and
                give birth to a new breed of Alien, the Neomorphs, the android David 8 rescues them. It is revealed that
                he brought Shaw to the planet, where he killed all non-floral life and began experimenting on Shaw's
                corpse to engineer his own breeds of Aliens. His motivations to replace human life with Aliens is made
                apparent, and with the birth of yet another new breed of Alien, a terraforming expert named Daniels and
                the remaining crew are forced to flee from the world. After disposing of the Aliens chasing them, the
                crew members return to the Covenant and are put back into cryosleep by someone they believe to be their
                shipboard synthetic, Walter. Only when Daniels is put in her cryopod does she realize that Walter has
                been replaced by the identical David. With the crew, colonists, and embryos at his mercy, David contacts
                Weyland-Yutani back on Earth, stating that while the majority of the crew was killed in the neutrino
                blast, they would continue to Origae-6.</p>
