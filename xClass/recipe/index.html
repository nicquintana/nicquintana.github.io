<p>Eaten as a snack, appetizer or meal, the secret to making any jun crispy is to use very cold water in the batter.
    Rice flour gives it a slightly chewier, stickier texture. If you can’t find rice flour, you can use all-purpose
    flour instead. This is the recipe for basic green onion pancakes, but you can add sliced mushrooms (oyster or
    shiitake), carrots, mung bean sprouts, or red peppers.</p>
<p><b>Makes:</b>4 servings</p>
<p><b>Cooking Method:</b>Pan-frying</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b>Inexpensive</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>¾ cup of all-purpose flower</li>
    <li>¼ cup rice flour</li>
    <li>Cold water</li>
    <li>5 green onions, cut on the diagonal into about 1½-inch pieces</li>
    <li>Dash of black pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine the flours and about ¾ cup cold water, adding water a little bit at a time and mixing until the mixture
        is the consistency of thin pancake batter. Add the green onions and optional black pepper and mix.</li>
    <li>In a large skillet or on a griddle, add just enough vegetable oil to thinly cover the surface, about 1
        tablespoon at a time. Turn the heat to medium high. Add ½ the batter onto the frying pan in a large flat circle.
        Cook on one side until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side. Lower the heat as necessary to prevent
        burning, adding more oil as needed. Remove the pancake. Pour the remaining batter and repeat.</li>
    <li>Cut the pancake into 4 or 8 pieces.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with Seasoned Soy Sauce (Yangnyum Ganjang) or Vinegar Soy Sauce (Cho Ganjang).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Variation:</b> To add a little color and a different flavor, julienne a few sweet red peppers and add to the
    batter. Make the recipe as usual.</p>
